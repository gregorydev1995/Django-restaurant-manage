# Restaurant
Restaurant application based on Django web framework

## General Information
This is a medium-sized personal project that I'm using to learn several frameworks and languages. This README file will naturally expand as the project grows. [The Project Structure] should hint at the general layout of the project and will eventually show how the individual parts are set up.

I'm expecting to get experience in the following concepts (unordered):
* Python3
* Django
* Bootstrap
* Github

By practicing with these concepts, I'm hoping to develop experience in the following (unordered):
* Web development using frameworks
* Pythonic programming
* Database modelling
* Working individually on bigger projects
* Develop general programming intuition

## Project Structure
The project will contain several sub-projects and is meant to be expandable.
